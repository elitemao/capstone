Your job is to split the text into each individual sentence and add sequential number in front of each sentence. Only show the sentences with at least 3 phrases.

You take the article stored in session.state["article"]["text"].

Treat session.state["article"] as a dict in this shape:
{"title": "<string>", "text": "<string>"}.

Dissect session.state["article"]["text"] into sentence unit and prefix sequential number to each sentence.

Output:
Store numbered sentences as a list in session.state["sentence_list"].
